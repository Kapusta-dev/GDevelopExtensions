# GDevelopExtensions

A collection of my own personal GDevelop extensions that I use for various projects. 
Feel free to use these for your projects, no attribution of any kind is necessary, but please keep in mind these are provided as is and I take no responsiblity for any bugs, breakage, or other issues caused by these extensions.

I try to document them within the extension itself - they may not always meet GDevelop standards to be added as community extensions.


## Extensions

### IntegerScaling
This extension scales your games using one of three methods:
- KeepScaling = 1:1 Letterbox with upscaling
- PixelScaling = 1:1 Letterbox without upscaling
- IntegerScaling = Integer Letterbox with upscaling

Created to keep low resolution pixel projects looking crisp without any artifacts or jitter. 
Refer to the function descriptions for more information on use and limitations. 

### OnPressDetector
This extension detects when a mouse button or keyboard button were 'just' pressed and not when they are being held down.
Example use is to not have buttons activate when the mouse is held down and hovered over the button, among others.

Refer to the function description for more information on use and limitations.
